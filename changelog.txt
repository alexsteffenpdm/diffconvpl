Version 0.2.0
    Findings:
        -   introducting a wider spread of data (i.e. more noise) increases the range of correct/fitting approximations significantly
    Changes:
        -   version-fixing in requirements_dev
        -   used Python version changed (3.9* --> 3.10.*) to accomodate bpy (the Blender Python module)
        -   added MemorySharedSubprocess to avoid errorless termination when passing data to the plot mechanism
        -   a lot of unused code is removed
    Notes:
        -   data generators in `src\generators` will be removed in version 0.2.1 and replaced with BlenderSceneHandler.layercut

Version 0.1.2
    Findings:
        -   currently the algorithm is not able to approximate an SDF when perfect input data is given ( i.e. all datapoints have a distance of ~0.0 from the surface)
    Changes:
        -   Added the a "grid" setting to SDF data generators (currently only for the circle generator)
        -   Code optimizations and cleanup
        -   The application does now use a contour plot in order to visualize the results. This will later be extended with a heightmap like plot in 3D.

Version 0.1.1
    Changes:
        -   Added data SDF data generators (square,triangle,circle).


Version 0.1
    This is a port from main branch.
    Changes:
        -   Added the ability to work with 2-dimensional input data.
