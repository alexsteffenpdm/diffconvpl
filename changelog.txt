Version 0.1.2
    Findings:
        -   currently the algorithm is not able to approximate an SDF when perfect input data is given ( i.e. all datapoints have a distance of ~0.0 from the surface)
    Changes:
        -   Added the a "grid" setting to SDF data generators (currently only for the circle generator)
        -   Code optimizations and cleanup
        -   The application does now use a contour plot in order to visualize the results. This will later be extended with a heightmap like plot in 3D.

Version 0.1.1
    Changes:
        -   Added data SDF data generators (square,triangle,circle).


Version 0.1
    This is a port from main branch.
    Changes:
        -   Added the ability to work with 2-dimensional input data.
