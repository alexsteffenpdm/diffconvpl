write relu/gelu class as comparator
write volumentric comparator (total and within z boundaries of inputs)

    mesh = obj.data

    bm = bmesh.new()
    bm.from_mesh(mesh)
    volume = bm.calc_volume()



write statistical comparator (modelsize, computation speed and quality)
write model exporter and recalculator and solver for given Z
setup docs
finish setup script
optimize model evalutation (vectorized approach + bounding box cutout)
generate/find other models to test against
setup blender file for visualization (good rendered shots)
code cleanup
error propagation
