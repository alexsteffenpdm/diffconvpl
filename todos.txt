OPEN:

write volumentric comparator (total and within z boundaries of inputs)

    mesh = obj.data

    bm = bmesh.new()
    bm.from_mesh(mesh)
    volume = bm.calc_volume()

write statistical comparator (modelsize, computation speed and quality)
write model exporter and recalculator and solver for given Z
setup docs
optimize model evaluation with bounding box cutout
generate/find other models to test against
setup blender file for visualization (good rendered shots)
code cleanup
error propagation

FINISHED:

write relu/gelu class as comparator
finish setup script
optimize model evaluation (vectorized approach)
